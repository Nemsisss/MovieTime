Meeting Participants: Daniel, Roza, Angela, Nemsiss, Sohee


Items in the sprint backlog are all the things we need to get done to finish the requirements before the end of the sprint. 
This includes added security to the login page, timeout for all the pages, and restricting access to certain pages to if the user is 
logged in. Other things we need to work on include additional hover features for the movie list, list comparing, movie list suggestions, 
and some added UI requirements (adding our team number and website name to the pages)


We chose these requirements since these are the things we must finish up before the end of the spirit to get points for the features. 
Since this is the last sprint, any and all outlying work and requirements must be finished. The list above includes all the last features 
we must implement for our stakeholder.

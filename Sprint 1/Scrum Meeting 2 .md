Angela:
1. What have you done since the last meeting?
   I added jest testing (currently 100% coverage for the javascript) for my current sign up page. I also added RegEx to check the password validity (if it’s strong enough).
2. What do you plan to do for the next meeting?
   I plan to fix the error messages to make it prettier and more specific to the error that occurred (not a valid email, different passwords, etc). I should also add a link to bring user back to log in if they wanted to log in instead.

Angela:
1. What have you done since the last meeting?
   I changed the layout of the signup page to follow what Sohee did for her login page in order
to have consistency. I also fixed the error messages so they are unique to the error (missing field,
email invalid format, passwords dont match, etc) so that it is more clear. Becaause of the changes,
I also had to go back in and fix my jest testing/add more in order to ensure coverage. I also added a 
blank link on the bottom that will be used to direct the user back to the login page.
2. What do you plan to do for the next meeting?
   I want to push everything into my feature branch, and then create a pull request into develop. After htis
I will help others with whatever they need help on.
3. Anything blocking your progress?
   Not at the moment.

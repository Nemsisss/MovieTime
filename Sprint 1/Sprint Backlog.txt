Meeting Participants: Daniel, Roza, Angela, Nemisiss, Sohee

Initial frontend for log in page, sign up page, movie search page, and a saved list page.
Create acceptance tests for the basic html.
Have basic API search feature on the movie search page (don't need to save information yet to backend).

We chose these items for the initial sprint backlog because we believe it is important to get the initial
HTML working first before worrying about backend. Without a way to interact with some sort of basic
website, it will be hard in the future to test our backend and connect it with an API. We also
want to focus on ensuring we can learn and use basic API features from the movieDB API we plan to
use, as it will help us progress smoothly in the future if we learn it now.

We also want to have basic acceptance testing done for the pages to make sure we follow the TDD approach to coding
and this will help us make sure our pages work as we create them.

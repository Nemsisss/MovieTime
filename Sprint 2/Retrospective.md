Summary of retrospective discussion, no more than 500 words that accounts for all feedback given in the grade report and sprint review. Discussion may be written as prose or as a bulleted list. For each feedback, answer one of the two questions.
 i. What process aspects will be changed? Explain why this will address the problem. 
ii. What tasks will be added to the product backlog as a result of review feedback?

Feedback:
Change search page to search by keyword instead of genre
This will be added to the product backlog so we know what exactly the stakeholder wants.
Ensure that we have sufficient jacoco test coverage by making sure to test SprintbootAPI
Regarding process aspects, we need make sure we closely follow TDD and that we are vigilant are making sure that we have enough coverage on everything.
Work on backend while working on frontend, since otherwise we won’t have enough time
This will change our process, since before we were just planning to completely finish front-end before doing backend, but the issue is since front-end keeps needing tweeks and there are parts of it that depend on backend, we need to start working on backend.
We need to make genre and actor name clickable in details page and when user clicks on them we need to use the clicked genre/actor name as a keyword and  redirect user to the search page and load movies based on that input.
This is going to be added to added to the product backlog since it is a new feature that the stakeholder wants to see in the front-end.
We need to add hover effects for both search and details page
Make the “add to list” feature responsive for mobile mode, by having an add button instead of the hover  when the app is used in mobile mode.
Additionally, we need to have load more button on search page and every time it’s being clicked we should load 10 more movies
This will change our process aspect, since we need to ensure we get pagination working in our front-end.
We also need to add a montage list of pictures
I will load a list of pictures and have them all slightly overlapping once we have pictures in the backend

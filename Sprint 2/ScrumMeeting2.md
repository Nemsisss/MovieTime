Angela:
1. What have you done since the last meeting?
I tried to do more research into how to do SQLite with springboot, but am struggling with that. I also looked more into finalizing the colors/fonts. 
2. What do you plan to do for the next meeting?
I will continue to look into how to do backend.
3. Anything blocking your progress?
The fact that I dont know how to do backend is stopping me, since I have no experience with it, and there isnâ€™t much stuff online for doing sqlite with springboot. 

Daniel:
1. What have you done since the last meeting?
     I have created a movie list page with a button to add movies.
2. What do you plan to do for the next meeting?
    I want to work more on getting the backend going and maybe setting  up our database tables. I will also write tests for my page.
3. Anything blocking your progress?
     Sqlite makes no sense.

Roza:
1. What have you done since the last meeting?
    I and Nemsiss implemented the movie details page, and we added the scrollable list for the actors of the specific movie.
2. What do you plan to do for the next meeting?
     For the next meeting, I plan to implement the drop-down for the search bar with 3 options ( keyword (genre), title and actor name.
3. Anything blocking your progress?
     Nothing at this moment is blocking my progress.

Nemsiss:
1. What have you done since the last meeting?
    I and Roza have implemented the movie details page.
2. What do you plan to do for the next meeting?
     I plan to implement the release date filter for the search page, for the next meeting. 
3. Anything blocking your progress?
     Nothing is blocking my progress for now.

Sohee:
1. What have you done since the last meeting?
Since the last meeting, I created new log-in files + test files that all work in the current develop environment (fixed my code to use the existing sign-up css files). I added redirection events between log-in and sign up files. I fixed minor cucumber issues due to the same step definition names. 

2. What do you plan to do for the next meeting?
For the next meeting, I plan to start working on the backend part of login and sign up after studying backend related materials.  

3. Anything blocking your progress?
     Studying SQLite and figuring out the backend configuration stuff for login and sign-up features.

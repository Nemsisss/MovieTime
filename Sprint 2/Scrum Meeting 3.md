Angela:
What have you done since the last meeting? I tried to do more research into how to do SQLite with springboot, but am struggling with that.
What do you plan to do for the next meeting? I will continue to look into how to do backend.
Anything blocking your progress? The fact that I dont know how to do backend is stopping me, since I have no experience with it, and there isn’t much stuff online for doing sqlite with springboot. 

Daniel:
What have you done since the last meeting? I implemented some jest tests.
What do you plan to do for the next meeting? I plan to try to get my cucumber tests working.
Anything blocking your progress? SQLite still makes no sense to me, and I am struggling to get the cucumber tests to run.

Roza:
What have you done since the last meeting? I have implemented the drop-down for the search bar with 3 options ( keyword (genre), title, and actor name.
What do you plan to do for the next meeting? For the next meeting, I plan to implement jest and cucumber use cases for the newly added features on the search page and for the details page.
Anything blocking your progress?  (REFER TO DANIEL’S POINT 3 FOR MY FEELINGS).

Nemsiss:
What have you done since the last meeting? I have implemented the release date filter for the search page since our last meeting.
What do you plan to do for the next meeting? I plan to create the Jest and cucumber tests of the search page for our next meeting.
Anything blocking your progress? Nothing is blocking my progress for now.

Sohee:
What have you done since the last meeting? Since the last meeting, I created PR requests for the modified code for the project. I also looked up for log-in and sign-up configuration using SQLite.
What do you plan to do for the next meeting? I still plan to study and look up for basic SQLite configuration regarding user authentication features. 
Anything blocking your progress? Studying SQLite… :(

What have you done since the last meeting? Since the last meeting, I fixed all the conflicts that happened in the PR request for the modified code for the project, and merged into the develop branch. I also looked up for log-in and sign-up configuration using SQLite and tried to implement the backend. 
What do you plan to do for the next meeting? I plan to study and look up for basic SQLite configuration regarding user authentication features (if we are using SQLite for our backend). I plan to work on the backend part. 
Anything blocking your progress? Studying SQLite…?! The fact that I’m new to backend part.

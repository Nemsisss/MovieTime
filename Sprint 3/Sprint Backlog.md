Meeting Participants: Daniel, Roza, Angela, Nemsiss, Sohee


Finish working on front-end and start working on backend so we can start to save user’s movie lists and display them appropriately.
Get tests done on SpringbootAPI so we can have good coverage for jacoco to not loose points in the future
Have signup, login (on successful registration) navigate user to the search page
Finish having the API call for login to see if user’s credentials are correct.


We chose these items for the initial sprint backlog because we believe it is important to start working on the backend since front-end is almost complete. THis will tie our overall website together and help ensure that we get more things working.


We need to make sure to also have testing for all these features, and make sure that we follow TDD when doing this.


We will need to begin working on defining our backend and linking together user tables with list tables and movie details tables

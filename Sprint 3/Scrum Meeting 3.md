Angela:
What have you done since the last meeting?
I confirmed that there are no bugs/issues with the login and signup, since Sohee mentioned that there might be issues with it. 

What do you plan to do for the next meeting? 
I will help out with others who may need help with their parts. I will also make sure that the fetch calls are correct since Sohee mentioned there might be issues with it.

Anything blocking your progress? 
Not at the moment.

Daniel:
What have you done since the last meeting? 
I have not really done much since last meeting

What do you plan to do for the next meeting? 
For next meeting I plan to start working on implementing the backend api calls in my pages

Anything blocking your progress? 
Not sure on where to make all the API calls yet

Roza:
What have you done since the last meeting?
Since our last meeting, Nemsiss and I have started the actual backend implementation for the search and details pages. We have added the “add to an existing list” and “create a new list” options for each movie.

What do you plan to do for the next meeting? 
For the next meeting, we plan to fix some errors that we currently have and modify the test cases accordingly. Also, we plan to work with Daniel to modify the API endpoints when a user wants to add a specific movie to the list.

Anything blocking your progress? 
Nothing at this moment is blocking my progress.
